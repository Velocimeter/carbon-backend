# Command Line Usage Rules

## Directory Navigation
Always use forward slashes for paths, even on Windows:
```bash
# ✅ Works everywhere
cd ../folder_name
cd ./subfolder
cd /absolute/path
cd C:/Users/path  # Windows absolute path

# ❌ Avoid backslashes
cd ..\folder_name  # Windows-only
cd .\subfolder    # Windows-only
cd C:\Users\path  # Windows-only
```

## Working Directory
Always verify and fix your location before running commands:
```bash
# 1. Check current directory
pwd

# 2. Navigate if needed - use relative paths when possible
cd ../project-name         # Go up and into project
cd ./subfolder            # Go into subfolder
cd ../../other-project    # Go up twice and into project

# 3. Verify you're in the right place
ls
# or
dir    # on Windows
```

## Docker Commands
Docker commands work the same on all platforms:
```bash
# Starting services
docker-compose up -d              # Start all services
docker-compose up service-name    # Start specific service

# Stopping services
docker-compose down              # Stop and remove all
docker-compose stop service-name # Stop specific service

# Checking status
docker ps                        # List running containers
docker-compose ps               # List compose services

# Logs
docker logs container-name      # View container logs
docker-compose logs -f         # Follow all logs
```

## Environment Variables
Set environment variables according to your shell:
```bash
# Bash/Linux/Mac
export VAR_NAME=value

# Windows CMD
set VAR_NAME=value

# Windows PowerShell
$env:VAR_NAME = "value"
```

## Common Gotchas
1. Wrong directory:
   ```bash
   # ❌ Running command in wrong place
   > docker-compose up
   ERROR: Can't find a suitable configuration file...
   
   # ✅ Check and fix location first
   > pwd
   /wrong/directory
   > cd ../right-directory
   > docker-compose up
   ```

2. Path separators:
   ```bash
   # ✅ Forward slashes work everywhere
   docker run -v ./local:/container
   
   # ❌ Backslashes only work on Windows
   docker run -v .\local:/container
   ```

3. File permissions:
   ```bash
   # If permission denied, check file mode
   ls -l script.sh
   
   # Make file executable if needed
   chmod +x script.sh    # Unix
   icacls script.sh /grant Users:F    # Windows
   ```
