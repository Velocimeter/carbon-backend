# Carbon Backend

Carbon Backend, built with [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com), serves as a specialized backend solution for aggregating insights from Carbon smart contracts and delivering them through APIs. It provides a suite of APIs offering valuable insights, such as trading activity and history.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Carbon Backend, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **[TimescaleDB](https://docs.timescale.com/self-hosted/latest/install)**: Ensure TimescaleDB is properly installed and running.
- **[Redis](https://redis.io/docs/install/install-stack)**: Ensure Redis is properly installed and running.
- **[CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)**: Obtain an API key from CoinGecko.
- **[CoinMarketCap](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api)**: Obtain an API key from CoinMarketCap.
- **Python 3 (Optional)**: Required for the simulator.

## Installation

To set up Carbon Backend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bancorprotocol/carbon-backend
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd carbon-backend
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Run database migrations**:

   After installing dependencies, run the following command to execute all migrations and prepare the database:

   ```bash
   npm run migration:run
   ```

5. Configure environment variables:

   Duplicate the `.env.example` file as `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Provide the required values in the `.env` file.

6. (Optional) If you wish to utilize the simulator feature, install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r src/simulator/requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run Carbon Backend:

```bash
npm start
```

## API Documentation

Access the API documentation by navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Seed Historic Quotes (Optional)

Manually run the `seed` function in `src/historic-quote/historic-quote.service.ts` to populate the database with historic quotes for history-dependent functionalities such as the simulator.

## Change Network

To switch Carbon Backend's network for different deployments, follow these steps:

1. **Replace Smart Contract Files**:

   - Replace files in `src/contracts/mainnet` with those from the new deployment.

2. **Modify CoinMarketCap Service**:

   - Adjust `src/coinmarketcap/coinmarketcap.service.ts` to align with the new network.
   - For guidance, check the [CoinMarketCap API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/).

3. **Modify CoinGecko Service**:

   - Adjust `src/quote/coingecko.service.ts` to match the requirements of the new network.
   - Refer to the [CoinGecko API documentation](https://docs.coingecko.com/) for assistance.

4. **Customizing Networks and Exchange IDs**:

   To configure which networks are supported by Carbon Backend, make the following changes in `deployment.service.ts` and `exchange-id-param.decorator.ts`.

   ### Supporting Multiple Networks

   If you want to support multiple networks, update the following:

   - **In `deployment.service.ts`**:

     - Update the `BlockchainType` and `ExchangeId` enums to reflect the networks you want to support:

       ```typescript
       export enum BlockchainType {
         Ethereum = 'ethereum',
         Sei = 'sei-network',
         Celo = 'celo',
         Blast = 'blast',
         // Add or remove entries as needed
       }

       export enum ExchangeId {
         OGEthereum = 'ethereum',
         OGSei = 'sei',
         OGCelo = 'celo',
         OGBlast = 'blast',
         // Add or remove entries as needed
       }
       ```

     - Modify `initializeDeployments` with configuration for each network, including `exchangeId`, `blockchainType`, `rpcEndpoint`, and other network-specific values:

       ```typescript
       private initializeDeployments(): Deployment[] {
         return [
           {
             exchangeId: ExchangeId.OGEthereum,
             blockchainType: BlockchainType.Ethereum,
             rpcEndpoint: this.configService.get('ETHEREUM_RPC_ENDPOINT'),
             harvestEventsBatchSize: 2000000,
             harvestConcurrency: 10,
             multicallAddress: '0x5Eb3fa2DFECdDe21C950813C665E9364fa609bD2',
             startBlock: 17087000,
             gasToken: {
               name: 'Ethereum',
               symbol: 'ETH',
               address: NATIVE_TOKEN,
             },
           },
           // Repeat this block for each network
         ];
       }
       ```

   - **In `exchange-id-param.decorator.ts`**:

     - Adjust `extractExchangeId` to support dynamic handling for multiple networks:

       ```typescript
       export function extractExchangeId(request: Request, exchangeIdParam?: string): ExchangeId {
         let exchangeId: ExchangeId;

         if (exchangeIdParam) {
           exchangeId = exchangeIdParam as ExchangeId;
         } else {
           let subdomain = request.hostname.split('.')[0];
           if (subdomain.endsWith('-api')) {
             subdomain = subdomain.slice(0, -4); // Remove '-api' suffix
           }
           if (subdomain === 'api') {
             subdomain = ExchangeId.OGEthereum; // Adjust to your preferred default network
           }
           exchangeId = subdomain ? (subdomain as ExchangeId) : (ExchangeId.OGEthereum as ExchangeId);
         }

         if (!Object.values(ExchangeId).includes(exchangeId)) {
           throw new Error(`Invalid ExchangeId: ${exchangeId}`);
         }

         return exchangeId;
       }
       ```

   ### Supporting a Single Network

   If supporting only one network, simplify the configuration:

   - **In `deployment.service.ts`**:

     - Set a single `BlockchainType` and `ExchangeId`, and configure `initializeDeployments` for only that network.

   - **In `exchange-id-param.decorator.ts`**:

     - Hardcode the `extractExchangeId` function to return only the supported `ExchangeId`:

       ```typescript
       export function extractExchangeId(request: Request, exchangeIdParam?: string): ExchangeId {
         const exchangeId = ExchangeId.OGEthereum; // Replace with the single supported ExchangeId

         if (exchangeIdParam && exchangeIdParam !== exchangeId) {
           throw new Error(`Unsupported ExchangeId: only ${exchangeId} is allowed`);
         }

         return exchangeId;
       }
       ```

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

Carbon Backend provides a command to automatically generate an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) from your TypeORM entities. This helps visualize the database structure and relationships between entities.

To generate the ERD:

```bash
npm run generate-erd
```

This command:

1. Scans all TypeORM entity files
2. Generates a Mermaid diagram definition
3. Creates two files:
   - `erd.mmd`: The Mermaid diagram definition file
   - `erd.svg`: The rendered diagram in SVG format

The diagram includes:

- All entities with their properties
- Property types
- Primary key indicators
- Relationships between entities (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
